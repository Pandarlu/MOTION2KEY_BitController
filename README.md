# MOTION2KEY_BitController
This project turns camera-based human pose into real-time game controls. 
It detects user actions via MediaPipe Pose enhanced with robust logic, and sends corresponding keystrokes to the foreground application—enabling full-body motion control for any game. The current version is fully compatible with BIT.TRIP RUNNER, a rhythm-based platformer.
It also logs joint movement metrics, and generates comprehensive Excel/CSV reports along with a dashboard summary of the previous game level. The analysis includes Action Counts, Range of Motion (ROM) per joint, and Grouped Averages by Action Type.
