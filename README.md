# MOTION2KEY_BitController
This project turns camera-based human pose into real-time game controls. It detects user actions via MediaPipe Pose enhanced with robust logic, and sends corresponding keystrokes to the foreground application—enabling full-body motion control for any game. The current version is fully compatible with BIT.TRIP RUNNER, a rhythm-based platformer.
